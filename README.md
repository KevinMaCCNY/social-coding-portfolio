# Social-Coding-Portfolio

This is where I will submit my Activities and Self Reflections for each assignment in this Foundamental Data Science Class. A little about me is that I already have a decent amount of prior knowledge as I have self taught the basics to Python during the quarentine of Covid 2021. I also have taken AP classes in high school regarding Java, and done a few online internships and college now classes. From this semester I am aiming to refresh my meomroies on coding functions and techniques.
