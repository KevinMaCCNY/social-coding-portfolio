Again, this activity was fair to me as I am familiar with functions. For side quest #1, it was somewhat challenging as you really have to understand what the Counter library does and how to ulitize it. I had to go up to the previous questions to rememeber how to use that function as well as searching it up again on w3schools.com
Also this is not related to coding, but for Side Quest#2 I don't know if the plane ticket price is the roundtrip price or singular price. But I assumed it was roundtrip and calculated that.
