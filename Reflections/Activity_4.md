For this activity, I was planning to do a Choose your own adventure game where you were doing choosing your morning routine. But I lost the data for my file and had to start over completely from scratch. So I decieded to make a game consisting of many different mini-games such as: Blackjack, Rock paper scissors, Coin Flip, and Number Guesser. I used the basic functions we learned in class such as for loops, while loops, def functions, and conditional statements. It was stresful as it was many bugs so I had to use an AI to help me debug. Overall, very fun again and would want to expand on this game in the future.
