For this activity I did not have too much trouble as I have some coding experience in python before. There was two parts where I had to think about it. The part where we had to clear the leading white spaces in a string, I had to search up on w3schools.com to refresh my memory. Same for the part where it asked to print the type of data for the variable I had declared. I am familiar with pandas and one of the pandas command is "dtypes()" and this caused some confusion to me as we have not learned about pandas yet. So I had to search up the python versions which was just "type()". Overall this activity was really a refresher for me to relearn the basics of python.
