For this activity I basically had to relearn everyting about pandas as I forgot how the functions work. During the time this activity was due I was sick and could not attend classes, so I do not know if we briefed over pandas in class. I used my previous class notes and also online sources not chatGPT haha. I mainly had trouble the function to create a plot as I did not remember any parameters I needed. But thankfully for my last semester class "Python for Businnes" I had to use the create a plot function with pandas. Overall, it didn't take me long to finish and very much enjoyed this activity !!
